2. Download and install Raspberry Pi Imager from the [official Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).

3. Open the imager, select the TF card to write the image to (ensure other USB devices are removed to avoid accidental data loss).

4. Configure the system in advance by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+X (or clicking the gear icon in the lower-right corner), then save your settings.

6. After flashing, open the `/boot/firmware/` directory on the TF card, edit the `config.txt` file, and add the following lines at the end:

   ```bash
   hdmi_enable_4kp60=1
   hdmi_force_hotplug=1
   hdmi_group=2
   hdmi_mode=87
   hdmi_timings=3840 0 48 32 80 2160 0 3 5 54 0 0 0 60 0 300000000 3
   hdmi_drive=2
   config_hdmi_boost=10
