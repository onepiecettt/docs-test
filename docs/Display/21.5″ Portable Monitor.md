6. After flashing, open the `/boot/firmware/` directory on the TF card, edit the `config.txt` file, and add the following lines at the end:

   ```bash
   hdmi_force_hotplug=1
   hdmi_group=2
   hdmi_mode=87
   hdmi_timings=1920 0 88 44 148 1080 0 4 5 36 0 0 0 120 0 297000000 3
   hdmi_drive=2
   ```
   

**Note:** The actual output resolution depends on the performance of the main controller. On devices such as Raspberry Pi 3 and Zero, the default maximum resolution is 1080P@60Hz.
