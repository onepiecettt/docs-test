### 4.1 Software Configuration

Supports Raspberry Pi OS / Ubuntu / Kali / Retropie systems.

1. Connect the TF card to your PC.

2. Download and install Raspberry Pi Imager from the [official Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).

3. Open the imager, select the TF card to write the image to (ensure other USB devices are removed to avoid accidental data loss).

4. Configure the system in advance by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+X (or clicking the gear icon in the lower-right corner), then save your settings.

5. Click the "Write" button to flash the image onto the TF card.

6. After flashing, open the `/boot/firmware/` directory on the TF card, edit the `config.txt` file, and add the following lines at the end:

   ```bash
   hdmi_force_hotplug=1
   hdmi_group=2
   hdmi_mode=87
   hdmi_timings=2560 0 48 32 80 1440 0 3 5 60 0 0 0 60 0 241500000 3
   hdmi_drive=2
   config_hdmi_boost=10
   ```

   **Note:** The actual output resolution depends on the performance of the main controller. On devices such as Raspberry Pi 3 and Zero, the default maximum resolution is 1080P@60Hz.

7. Insert the TF card into the Raspberry Pi.
